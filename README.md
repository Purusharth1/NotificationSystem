This project is a C# application designed to demonstrate the principle of **polymorphism**. It implements a flexible notification system that can process and send various types of messages (Email, SMS, Push) through a common, unified interface.

The primary focus of this project is on high-quality software design, clean and maintainable code, and robust unit testing.

## üéØ Core Concepts Demonstrated

* **Polymorphism:** The `NotificationSender` class works seamlessly with any object that inherits from the `Notification` base class, calling the correct `Send` method for each specific type at runtime.
* **Abstraction:** An `abstract class` (`Notification`) is used to define a common contract and share base properties (`Recipient`, `Message`) among all concrete notification types.
* **Dependency Injection:** Instead of depending on a static resource like `Console`, the system's `Send` methods accept a `TextWriter` dependency. This decouples the core logic from the output mechanism and is the key to making the system easily and reliably testable.
* **Unit Testing:** The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests using MSTest to verify the functionality of each component and the overall polymorphic design.

The following UML diagram illustrates the polymorphic design and relationships between classes:

*The diagram shows the inheritance hierarchy with the abstract `Notification` base class and its concrete implementations, along with the `NotificationSender` that uses polymorphism to work with all notification types.*

## üí° Design and Architecture

A key requirement of this project was a high-quality, testable design.

The decision to use an `abstract class` over an interface was made because all notification types share common data (`Recipient` and `Message`), not just a common behavior (`Send`). The abstract class allows us to define and validate these properties in one place.

The most significant design decision was refactoring the system to use **Dependency Injection for I/O**. An initial design might have used `Console.WriteLine` directly, which creates a hard dependency on a static, global resource, making unit testing difficult and unreliable. By modifying the `Send` methods to accept a `TextWriter` parameter, we inverted the dependency. The core logic no longer knows *where* it's writing to; it only knows it has a writer. This allowed the unit tests to provide a `StringWriter` to capture the output for verification, making the tests simple, fast, and 100% reliable.
